# UniAct: Enhancing Campus Togetherness for TUL Students
Our project, UniAct, aims to address the socialization challenges faced by TUL students, particularly international students, by providing a user-oriented solution that fosters togetherness on the university campus.

## Process
The process began with extensive user research, including interviews and surveys, to understand the specific needs and preferences of the target audience. With identified problems such as limited awareness of campus activities, difficulty in finding like-minded individuals, language barriers, and the absence of a centralized platform for social interactions, we designed the UniAct app. This interactive solution featured personalized activity recommendations, a user-friendly interface, chat functionality, and detailed user profiles. Through usability testing and feedback gathering, we refined and improved the app design. The positive user feedback highlighted UniAct's effectiveness in overcoming social barriers and fostering a sense of togetherness on campus.
